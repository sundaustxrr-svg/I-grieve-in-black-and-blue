# I-grieve-in-black-and-blue
More stuff in detail basically

so I'm really into the dsmp so please do not bash me with hateful comments for still being in the fandom. it is a huge comfort to me and I will not tolerate being yelled at for being into it in 2026 of all things. please do not. just don't.

we get upset easily so beware of what you say(unless sarcastically or jokingly). Do not bring up sensitive topics, basic want please

really attatched to this one person that we call father. which I fear I've been mirroring a bit.. I don't mean to but really-

can we talk about something? OFC.

please int unless said not to, I hope people understand this is a common and basic boundary. simply don't if you're not sure.
